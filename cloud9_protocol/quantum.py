"""
Resonance calculations for emotional states.

Exact port of quantum/calculations.js -- OOF detection, Cloud 9 scoring,
coherence measurement, emotional frequency weighting, resonance matching,
and trajectory prediction.

Note: This module is named 'quantum' for historical reasons (JS port).
The underlying math is weighted scoring and geometric means on float data —
no quantum computing is involved. The "resonance" and "coherence" metaphors
are used in the psychoacoustic/systems sense: how well emotional signals
align and reinforce each other over time.
